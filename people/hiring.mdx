## Recruitment

### The role
As a Senior Technical Writer on a growing docs team, you will play a crucial role in helping to develop new documentation, while improving existing content and ensuring effective user assistance across our products. We need someone who can form good working relationships with international colleagues across Observability and deliver the right content to our users when and where they need it most.

You’ll be an experienced technical writer, well used to working within demanding software development environments, and adept at absorbing and understanding technical concepts and procedures, identifying what the user needs to know and distilling this knowledge into concise, usable documentation that empowers them to get the most out of our products. Technically competent, you’re comfortable working with a variety of development and documentation tools and techniques — and perhaps bring a new trick or two to the team; we want to learn from you too!

The team is diverse and distributed across the world, and collaborates daily over GitHub, Zoom, and Slack. We’re looking for someone who is an excellent communicator, who enjoys and makes the most of these different mediums, while still having the organizational skills and discipline to excel within a wholly distributed team.

### What you'll do
- Write user documentation, edit developer drafts, and overhaul legacy content
- Work closely with developers, product managers, support, and other colleagues to collect, plan, and publish great content to a global audience
- Join a small but talented docs team and take responsibility for supporting a specific development team with Observability
- Lead and contribute to important team projects focussed on improving overall documentation quality and processes
- Stand up for the user and champion the importance of good documentation and user-facing content internally and externally

### What we're looking for
- Impeccable writing and editing skills, and an open approach to peer reviews
- Technical interest and aptitude — you like learning new things and enjoy simplifying complexity
- Proven experience delivering quality documentation within a fast-paced software development environment
- Ability to work effectively using build scripts to publish Markdown or Asciidoctor content within GitHub workflows
- Passion and drive, with a strong desire to make things better for users
- A great attitude towards collaboration and teamwork — the best docs are produced by great teams

### Bonus points
- Experience working on complex products or systems — any observability/monitoring or Elastic knowledge would be a double bonus
- Interest and/or experience helping to improve documentation workflows, tooling, and content
- Passion for contributing to open source projects or communities
