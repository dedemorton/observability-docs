## Our mission
<DocBadge template="experimental" />We don't have a team charter or mission yet...but if we did it would be something like this:

<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Deliver great docs to our users, when and where they need it most, by providing the framework and expertise to support development teams and leverage community contributions. " />

## Short-term goals [WIP]
- Improve and document our team processes / how we work
- Make it easier for Elastic contributors to start writing documentation
- Increase bandwidth by hiring and contracting
- Get more user data and feedback
- Defining a team vision and goals (inc. OKRs/KPIs)
- Having a clear plan for Next migration
- Running an Obs Docs SpaceTime week
- Running a light content audit on our docs
- Identifying potential tactical fixes to DUX
- Communicating more via emails and All Hands
- Developing an effective Docs Strategy
