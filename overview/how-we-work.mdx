## The ideal
- Every team/topic to have a primary writer
- Build up relations and technical knowledge in selected areas
- Attending useful team meetings, active in team/project slack channels
- Providing the specialist writer expertise across mediums, formats
- But always part of the Observability Documentation team
  - Handle own recruitment, management, personal development
  - Enables deputisation, load balancing, peer reviews etc.
  - All doc tasks on one board (writing, special projects etc.)
  - Team projects: anything not writing docs for a dev update

## Teams and writers

| Person            | Role                    | Area |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Brandon Morelli  | Senior Technical Writer | APM, Integrations |
| Colleen McGinnis    | Senior Technical Writer | Uptime, Synthetics, User experience (RUM) |
| DeDe Morton     | Senior Technical Writer | Infrastructure and Logs UI, Fleet and Agent |
| Oliver Howell       | Team Lead | Unified Observability, Alerting |

## Meetings

We currently meet twice a week:

### Tuesday - Obs Docs Sync

|       |              |
| ----- |------------- |
| Summary | Re-connect as a team, briefly discuss plans for the week, and any highlights from previous week.
| Format | No agenda, roundtable format based on main board; ‘host’ on rotation and picked by a [bot][0]; no notes or recording needed.
| Best for | Catching up as humans (general chat for a bit before host makes the call to move to roundtable); quick run thru of what you’re working on, high level not details; identify blockers or any issues/meetings that would benefit from a colleague.
| Not best for | Digging into much detail or trying to cover important topics / make decisions.

### Thursday - Obs Docs Weekly

|       |              |
| ----- |------------- |
| Summary | Regular weekly meeting to discuss important topics.
| Format | Agenda-driven, anyone can suggest and lead topics; Doc Lead as meeting organizer (with deputy when absent) and also responsible for adding notes and ensuring recording is uploaded to [folder][1] (via ZAT).
| Best for | Issues/documents/projects that need some discussion, ideally with some prep or information shared in advance; normally several smaller topics but also possible for single topic discussions where everyone is available; special guests.
| Not best for | Repeating what we do in Sync.

## Communications

### Weekly team standup thread

We do a weekly standup thread in [#obs-docs][2]:

* What are you planning to do this week?
* Any blockers or help needed?

### Observability Weekly Email

We *occasionally** include a Documentation section with the weekly Observability update email sent by Alvaro.

### Monthly Observability Docs Email
