== Apache metrics input

Use the `apache/metrics` input to periodically fetch metrics
from https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache HTTPD] servers. The default metricset is
`status`.

*Compatibility:* The Apache metricsets were tested with Apache 2.4.12 and 2.4.20
and are expected to work with all versions >= 2.2.31 and >= 2.4.16.

Example: 

[source,yaml]
----
- module: apache
  metricsets: ["status"]
  period: 10s
  enabled: true

  # Apache hosts
  hosts: ["http://127.0.0.1"]

  # Path to server status. Default server-status
  #server_status_path: "server-status"

  # Username of hosts.  Empty by default
  #username: username

  # Password of hosts. Empty by default
  #password: password
----

The `apache/metrics` input supports the following settings, grouped by category.
Many of these settings have sensible defaults that allow you to run {agent}
with minimal configuration.

<<input-apache-metrics-metricset-settings>>::
Available metricsets and their settings.

<<input-apache-metrics-standard-settings>>::
Standard settings available to any metrics input.

<<input-apache-metrics-standard-http-settings>>::
Standard settings for inputs or metricsets that define the host as an HTTP URL.

//TODO: Add missing agent-related settings.

to local pipes:

* `http+unix://` to connect to UNIX sockets.
* `http+npipe://` to connect to Windows named pipes.
