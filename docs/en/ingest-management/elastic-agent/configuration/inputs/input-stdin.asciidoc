Use the `stdin` input to read events from standard in.

NOTE: This input cannot be run at the same time with other input types.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  - type: stdin
----

The `stdin` input supports the following settings, grouped by category.
Many of these settings have sensible defaults that allow you to run {agent}
with minimal configuration.

//QUESTION: Does it make sense to have a section for commonly used settings?
//I'm thinking "no" because this seems like mostly an input you'd use for
//testing.

<<input-stdin-harvester-settings>>::

<<input-stdin-data-parsing-settings>>::
