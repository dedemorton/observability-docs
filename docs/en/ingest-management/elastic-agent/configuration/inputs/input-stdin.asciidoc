**REVIEWERS:** Do we need to document this input for Elastic Agent? It has a
lot of shared settings with the filestream input and hasn't been updated for
quite awhile.

I'll wait to hear back before I add the settings reference info here.

Use the `stdin` input to read events from standard in.

NOTE: This input cannot be run at the same time with other input types.

Example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  - type: stdin
----

The `stdin` input supports the following settings. Many of these settings have
sensible defaults that allow you to run {agent} with minimal configuration.
