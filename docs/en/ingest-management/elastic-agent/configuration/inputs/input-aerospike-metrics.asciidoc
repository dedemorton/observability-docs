== Aerospike metrics input

Use the `aerospike/metrics` input to collect metrics from the 
http://www.aerospike.com/docs/reference/info[Info command]. The default
metricset is `namespace`.

*Compatibility:* The Aerospike metricsets were tested with Aerospike 3.9 and are
expected to work with all versions >= 3.9.

Example:

//TODO: convert to correct config syntax for agent. 

[source,yaml]
----
metricbeat.modules:
- module: aerospike
  metricsets: ["namespace"]
  enabled: true
  period: 10s
  hosts: ["localhost:3000"]
----

The `aerospike/metrics` input supports the following settings, grouped by category.
Many of these settings have sensible defaults that allow you to run {agent}
with minimal configuration.

<<input-aerospike-metrics-metricset-settings>>::
Available metricsets and their settings.

<<input-aerospike-metrics-standard-settings>>::
Standard settings available to any metrics input.

<<input-aerospike-metrics-standard-http-settings>>::
Standard settings for inputs or metricsets that define the host as an HTTP URL.
