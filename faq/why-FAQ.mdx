If you put enough writers together in a room long enough, they will discuss and argue the relative merits of a Frequently Asked Questions section.

Used correctly, and alongside full conceptual, how-to and reference documentation, it can be a very useful content type. For this teamspace we can use this section to build up answers to common questions, make them extremely findable, and connect readers to relevant pages.
